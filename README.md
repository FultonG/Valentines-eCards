# Valentines-eCards
The goal is to have this webapp hosted so you can share the link with someone. The webapp will generate a link like
`http://futuredomain.com/#/firstperson/secondperson`
that you can send to a loved one.

This project was made so that I could play with Sammy.js as well as to remember how to use mongodb with node.
